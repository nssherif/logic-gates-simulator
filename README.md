<h3 align="center">Logic Gate Simulator in Java</h3>

---

 This is part of the first assignment I did in term 5 of my Computer Engineering bachelors degree.
    <br> This assignment uses object oriented programming concepts to build a logic
    gate simulator which can calcuate the results of logic gates given inputs.
    <br> The following logic gates can be simulated with a clock. <br>
- And Gate 
- Or gate
- Not Gate
- D Flip Flop

## :thinking: Why Use it? 
Because logic gates are cool when your computer does the computation. :stuck_out_tongue: :nerd_face:

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This was part of the first assignment of the course ECE 5010 Software Design. This assignment was done in the second week of class in my 5th term as a computer engineering student. This assignment uses object oriented programming concepts in Java to make a math logic gate simulator. The IDE that was used was Eclipse and I suggest that you use Eclipse as well to pull this project down. 

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need Eclipse for your IDE
You will also need the latest JAVA JDK

### Installing

It's important that you first install Java before Eclipse.  

```
Step 1: Install the latest Java JDK from here. (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
```

```
Step 2: Install Eclipse from here.( https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Once Eclipse and Java are installed. Open the project in your eclipse workspace and run the tests which can be found in the file director (/testsrc/digital/test). You should see the results of the logic gates when you run these simulations.
